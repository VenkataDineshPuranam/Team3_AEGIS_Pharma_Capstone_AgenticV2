# Prompt 10 — Implementation Tasks

**Lifecycle stage:** Spec-Driven Development — Implementation Tasks  
**Framework derived:** Spec-Driven Development (executable task units for AI agents)  
**Core question:** What code needs writing — as numbered, handoff-ready tasks?  
**Prerequisites:** Prompt 08 technical design + traceability; Prompt 09 Lean/DMAIC build constraints.  
**Primary output type:** Numbered task files (one task per file) + ordered execution plan.

---

## Intent

Break the governed slice into **small, independently reviewable tasks** an agent can execute one at a time. Each task points at the exact specs it needs — never a 200-page blob.

SDD: tasks are numbered units; retrieval pulls only the relevant feature + technical + architecture files.

---

## Entry criteria

- Technical contracts and traceability matrix exist.  
- Architecture review from Prompt 07 is `pass` or `conditional` (not `fail`); conditional items are reflected in tasks or residual risk.  
- Prompt 09 `structural_reopen.md` gate is **`cleared`** (reopen of 06–08 completed if it was required).  
- Lean must-fix / Measure-first / assumption-test priorities exist.  
- Out-of-scope remains explicit.
- Specs are mirrored under `packages/contracts/` and `docs/engineering/` so tasks can cite repo paths.
- AC register from Prompt 05 is available so test tasks can be mapped 1:1.

## Produce

### A. Task index / execution order

Ordered list of tasks with dependencies. Prioritize:

1. Assumption tests / Measure instrumentation (if hypothesis/provisional or Lean Measure-first)  
2. Foundational contracts (schema, error envelope, health)  
3. Features in dependency order  
4. **Tests mapped to ACs** — required: every in-scope AC has at least one test task (or an explicit deferral with risk). Mirror an AC→test plan under `specs/testing/`.  
5. Docs/deployment only as needed for the slice

Also produce `ac_test_plan.md` (and mirror to `tests/contract/ac_test_plan.md`):

| AC ID | Test task ID(s) | Test type | Status |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| AC-00N | task-00N | unit/integration/e2e | planned |

### B. One file per task (`task-00N.md`)

Each task must include:

1. **Goal** — one sentence  
2. **Specs to load** — exact paths (feature file, API section, ADR IDs, C4 view, module rules)  
3. **Out of scope for this task**  
4. **Implementation steps** — checklist  
5. **Acceptance checks** — which AC/BR/NFR this task proves  
6. **Test expectations** — what tests to add/update  
7. **Done when** — binary exit criteria  

### C. Mapping

- Task → FR → AC → contract rows from the traceability matrix  
- Tasks that are blocked on open ambiguities must be marked `blocked` (do not hand to the agent)

### Lean / DMAIC lens (spine — thin)

**DMAIC focus this stage:** **Improve** sequencing — turn Prompt 09 constraints into task order.

In `dmaic_lens.md` (short), record:

1. Which tasks implement Measure-first / must-fix-before-build items?  
2. Which tasks are deferred because they are Overproduction or Model waste?  
3. How assumption-test tasks reduce Unknown baselines?  
4. Any blocked tasks that are really Waiting on evidence acquisition?

## Exit criteria (handoff to Prompt 11)

- [ ] Architecture review is `pass` or `conditional` with conditions mapped into tasks/risks.  
- [ ] Prompt 09 structural reopen gate is `cleared`.  
- [ ] Tasks cover the minimum governed slice end to end.  
- [ ] `ac_test_plan.md` maps every in-scope AC to a test task or explicit deferral.  
- [ ] Each task lists the only specs an agent should read.  
- [ ] Lean/assumption-test priorities appear first when required.  
- [ ] Blocked tasks are explicit; no silent guessing left as a task.  
- [ ] One task ≈ one agent run (reviewable in one sitting).  
- [ ] Task files are mirrored under `plans/active/`; AC test plan mirrored under `tests/contract/`.  
- [ ] `dmaic_lens.md` is complete.

---

## Constraints

- Do not implement code in this prompt.  
- Do not create mega-tasks (“build the whole checkout”). Split them.  
- Do not reference specs that do not exist yet.  
- Do not re-run full Prompt 09 — apply its build constraints.

---

## Output

Write under `plans/active/10-tasks/` **and mirror** to `workshop/participant-output/10-tasks/` (and `tests/contract/` for the AC test plan):

- `task_index.md`
- `task-001.md` … `task-00N.md`
- `ac_test_plan.md`
- `dmaic_lens.md`
